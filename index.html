                        <p>This interactive map app was custom created using <b>LeafletJS</b> as well as data layers from ESRI ArcGIS Online (AGOL). It is meant to display my understanding of creating custom web maps using <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</b> While I am proficient with AGOL, my knowlege of web languages allows for more control and customization of projects. Please explore by clicking on and hovering over a state to see my code in action!</p>
